## Task 0 Delta

- Admitted exactly `:catalog:domain`, `:catalog:storage`, `:catalog:runtime`, and
  `:feature:catalog` with the approved production and test dependency graph.
- Added the minimal Android-library convention and explicit `debug`, `release`,
  `benchmarkRelease`, and `nonMinifiedRelease` library variants.
- Re-admitted only the reviewed KSP, Room, Lifecycle, and Coil aliases; Room/KSP are
  owned by storage, Coil is owned by the feature, and no HTTP client/network module is admitted.
- Removed Room's unused multi-process invalidation service from the storage library manifest so
  all app variants preserve the Step 1 no-background-service startup ratchet.
- Added exact Step 2 build-surface and production package-SCC verifiers and wired them
  into `verifyArchitecture` without weakening the Step 1 app startup/manifest gates.
- Replaced the Step 1 blanket Catalog/project-edge bans with exact graph and narrow
  app import authority; the only permitted app-facing Catalog symbol is
  `app.openstory.catalog.feature.CatalogEntryPoint`.
- Updated product authority so Manga and Light Novel are enabled from Step 2 while
  Search remains later scope.
- Persisted the reviewed design and plan at their canonical paths.

No production Catalog behavior, seed source, plugin harness, remote transport, Room schema,
or UI implementation is introduced by Task 0.

## Agent-Owned Evidence

- `./gradlew :build-logic:test --no-daemon` - PASS, 60 tests, 2026-09-09.
- `./gradlew :catalog:domain:test :catalog:storage:compileDebugKotlin :catalog:runtime:compileDebugKotlin :feature:catalog:compileDebugKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS, 2026-09-09.
- `./gradlew :app:tasks --all --no-daemon` - PASS; all four merged-manifest startup
  verification tasks are registered, 2026-09-09.
- `./gradlew verifyProductionPackageStructure --configuration-cache --no-daemon`
  run twice - PASS; first run stored and second run reused configuration cache, 2026-09-09.
- `bash -n scripts/tests/v2-step2-build-surface-test.sh` under Git Bash - PASS, 2026-09-09.
- `./gradlew :app:verifyDebugMergedManifestStartup :app:verifyReleaseMergedManifestStartup
  :app:verifyBenchmarkReleaseMergedManifestStartup
  :app:verifyNonMinifiedReleaseMergedManifestStartup --no-daemon` - PASS for all four variants
  after removing Room's unused `MultiInstanceInvalidationService`, 2026-09-09.

## Required User-Owned Gate

Status: **PASS**

The first user attempt failed because `VerifyProductionPackageStructureTask` accessed
`Task.project` during execution, and the requested Step 2 script path was absent. Both issues
are remediated: the task now consumes an injected root directory property, the legacy Step 1
script is restored unchanged, and the Step 2 script exists at the requested path.

The second user attempt produced mixed evidence: the Step 2 shell gate passed, while the broad
Gradle gate exposed Room 2.8.4's transitive `MultiInstanceInvalidationService` in all four app
merged manifests. The storage manifest now removes that unused multi-process service, and the
four focused merged-manifest verification tasks pass.

```bash
./gradlew verifyArchitecture :app:verifyFoundation --no-daemon
bash scripts/tests/v2-step2-build-surface-test.sh
```

The user returned concise `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` evidence for the requested final rerun on
2026-09-09. Combined with the previously returned complete shell-gate output, both required
Task 0 commands are accepted as PASS.

## Task 0 Self-Review

- The active policy and settings contain exactly the approved 11-module graph; production and
  test edges match the Task 0 contract, including `:app <-> :benchmark` test-only ownership.
- Android library variants are explicit for `debug`, `release`, `benchmarkRelease`, and
  `nonMinifiedRelease`, with release fallbacks and no framework plugin hidden in the convention.
- Room/KSP remain confined to `:catalog:storage`; Coil remains confined to `:feature:catalog`;
  no OkHttp, concrete HTTP transport, release seed, or plugin harness is admitted.
- App ownership remains one narrow `:feature:catalog` edge and the only permitted Catalog import
  is `app.openstory.catalog.feature.CatalogEntryPoint`.
- All four app merged-manifest verification tasks remain active. Room's unused multi-process
  invalidation service is removed without weakening the no-service verifier or allowing another
  provider, initializer, receiver, or forbidden permission.
- Package-SCC and build-surface tasks declare configuration-cache-safe inputs and remain wired
  into `verifyArchitecture` with the Step 1 identity/foundation gates.
- Task 0 adds no Catalog Kotlin/Java production behavior; the only production source artifact is
  the storage manifest override required to preserve the accepted startup boundary.

Result: **PASS; no unresolved in-scope defect found.**

## Task 1 Delta

- Added the pure-JVM Catalog domain contract for source-stable identity, strict UTF-8/scalar
  limits, typed failures, host-owned provenance, semantic section models, acquisition/read/write
  ports, publication commands, and bounded mutation diagnostics.
- Froze `SourceStoryIdV1` and cover-revision domain-separated SHA-256 framing with full lowercase
  256-bit vectors; malformed UTF-16 is rejected before encoding and opaque source identity is not
  trimmed, normalized, case-folded, or derived from mutable metadata.
- Added typed remote HTTPS locator normalization with IDNA/STD3 host canonicalization, default-443
  removal, exact raw path/query preservation, relative redirect revalidation, and rejection of
  userinfo, fragments, non-HTTPS/non-DNS authorities, controls, backslashes, and oversized input.
- After the first broad gate exposed the module policy's intentional `java.net` ban, replaced the
  initial JDK URI/IDN adapter with domain-owned HTTPS parsing, RFC-style relative dot-segment
  resolution, conservative IDNA/STD3 validation, and RFC 3492 Punycode encoding. The architecture
  policy remains unchanged and no network implementation was admitted.
- Added acquisition/publication validators for the frozen identifier, text, collection, rating,
  timestamp, semantic-section, provenance, cover-alignment, and Story Detail bounds. Public
  validation failures cross the boundary as `CatalogFailure.Validation`; cancellation cannot be
  wrapped as a Catalog failure.
- Added deterministic Popular/Latest Updates/Top Rated projection and exact 5/9/5 caps while
  preserving original rating values/scales and excluding missing or invalid eligibility signals.
- Kept `:catalog:domain` Android/Room/Compose/Coil/HTTP-client/plugin DTO-free with one-way package
  ownership matching the reviewed Task 1 file map.

## Task 1 Agent-Owned Evidence

- TDD RED: `./gradlew :catalog:domain:test --no-daemon` failed at compile time on the missing Task 1
  domain symbols, as expected, before production implementation.
- Focused final tree: `./gradlew :catalog:domain:test :catalog:storage:compileDebugKotlin
  :catalog:runtime:compileDebugKotlin :feature:catalog:compileDebugKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS,
  41 domain tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped after broad-gate remediation, 2026-09-09.
- Post-`ReturnCount` remediation: `./gradlew :catalog:domain:test --no-daemon` - PASS,
  `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 6 actionable tasks, 2026-09-09.
- `git diff --check` - PASS, 2026-09-09.
- Focused forbidden-framework scan of `catalog/domain/src` and its build file found no
  Android/Room/Compose/Coil/OkHttp/plugin/quarantined-Catalog imports, 2026-09-09.
- Focused remediation scans found zero `java.net` imports and zero production lines above the
  Detekt 120-character threshold, 2026-09-09.

## Task 1 User-Owned Gate Evidence

Final result on 2026-09-09: **PASS; Task 1 accepted.**

```bash
./gradlew verifyArchitecture detekt --no-daemon
```

- `verifyApplicationIdentity`, app structure/boot boundaries, all four merged-manifest startup
  checks, Step 2 production package structure, and Step 2 build surface passed.
- `verifyModuleBoundaries` rejected exactly three Task 1 imports: `java.net.IDN`, `java.net.URI`,
  and `java.net.URISyntaxException` from `RemoteHttpsUriV1`.
- Detekt reported 14 Task 1 errors: seven magic-number findings and seven maximum-line-length
  findings. Existing quarantined Catalog/Reader long-method/complexity diagnostics were warnings,
  not the Task 1 failure cause.
- Remediation removed all `java.net` usage without weakening module policy, named the flagged hash
  shift/mask and semantic-cap constants, wrapped all flagged long lines, and expanded domain tests
  with independent Punycode/redirect vectors.
- Second run passed `verifyApplicationIdentity`, both app source-structure checks, all four merged-
  manifest startup checks, Step 2 package/build-surface checks, and `verifyModuleBoundaries` for 11
  modules. Detekt then failed on one remaining Task 1 issue: `DnsHostCanonicalizer.encodeCodePoint`
  had three returns versus the configured limit of two. Existing Catalog/Reader long-method,
  large-class, and complexity diagnostics remained warnings and did not fail the task.
- The Punycode encoder now preserves the same three branches through one expression return; the
  focused domain vectors remain green.
- Final user-owned rerun: `./gradlew verifyArchitecture detekt --no-daemon` - PASS,
  `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 2026-09-09. The pre-existing Catalog/Reader complexity diagnostics remain
  non-blocking warnings under the repository Detekt policy.

## Task 1 Self-Review

- Golden IDs/revisions use exact domain prefixes, NUL separator, unsigned big-endian length
  framing, full SHA-256 output, and strict UTF-8; cover URI revision uses the frozen 4,096-character
  locator ceiling rather than incorrectly treating it as a byte ceiling.
- Validation distinguishes malformed input, over-limit input, authority mismatch, and invariant
  violations; acquisition payloads contain no source key/version/timestamp or trusted revision
  authority that could impersonate the host binding.
- Publication commands revalidate scalar/collection shape, contiguous section positions,
  duplicate positions/Stories, source/media/version alignment, and cover locator/key alignment
  before the future storage boundary.
- Semantic projection has deterministic ordering and bounded output; no V1 canonical/fusion type,
  framework exception, network implementation, persistence implementation, or UI concern entered
  the domain module.
- The custom locator parser preserves absolute raw path/query identity, normalizes dot segments
  only while resolving relative redirects, canonicalizes IDNA dot/case forms, rejects leading
  combining marks and unsafe authorities, and is covered by independent `bücher`, `mañana`,
  Japanese, mixed-hyphen, and sharp-s vectors.
- No unresolved in-scope defect was found in the Task 1 dependency cone.

## Task 2 Delta

- Added the new `hikari-v2-catalog.db` Room schema baseline at version 1 with exactly the four
  Task 2 product tables: `catalog_source_state`, `story_source_identity`,
  `story_source_summary`, and `discover_card`; no V1 entity or migration chain is imported.
- Added database-backed uniqueness for exact `(source_key, source_story_id)`, `story_id`,
  Discover section positions, and per-section Story membership, with indexed current-generation
  lookup and foreign-key ownership.
- Added one atomic Discover publication transaction that revalidates the bounded command at the
  storage boundary, verifies exact source identity fail-closed, upserts identity/summary data,
  writes one bounded materialized generation, advances durable source state, and removes the
  obsolete generation. First publication is generation 1; `Long.MAX_VALUE` fails closed rather
  than wrapping.
- Added one coherent Room Flow query whose left side is `catalog_source_state` and whose only
  observed join is the bounded `discover_card` generation. It preserves `Absent` versus durable
  `Published(empty)` and orders `POPULAR -> LATEST_UPDATES -> TOP_RATED`, then item position,
  without observing Story summary/detail tables.
- Added lazy `CatalogStorageFactory.open()` ownership, open/read/write failure translation,
  cancellation preservation, and idempotent `RoomCatalogStore.close()`.
- Added real Room instrumentation contracts for fresh/empty/reopen state, materialized field
  round-trip, deterministic ordering, one coherent SQL query per invalidation snapshot, absence
  of detail/child-table read requirements, database uniqueness, typed identity collision,
  storage-boundary position/cap rejection, and generation overflow preservation.

## Task 2 Agent-Owned Evidence

- TDD RED: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` failed at
  compile time on the missing Task 2 DB/store/factory symbols before production implementation,
  as expected, 2026-09-09.
- Focused GREEN: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS,
  `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 20 actionable tasks, 2026-09-09.
- Focused final gate: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:assembleDebug
  :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`,
  36 actionable tasks on the final source tree, 2026-09-09.
- Post-Detekt remediation compile: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:assembleDebug
  :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` in 23s,
  36 actionable tasks, 2026-09-09.
- Generated schema review confirms version 1 contains only the four Task 2 product tables, both
  identity uniqueness authorities, both Discover uniqueness authorities, and the intended
  foreign keys/indices.
- Generated DAO review confirms the observer tracks only `catalog_source_state` and
  `discover_card` and executes one `LEFT JOIN discover_card` query for each invalidation read.
- Focused source scan found no forbidden Compose/Coil/OkHttp/`java.net`/quarantined Catalog
  imports, no production or test Kotlin line over 120 characters, and no trailing whitespace.

## Task 2 Required User-Owned Gate

Status: **PASS**

```bash
./gradlew :catalog:storage:connectedDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=app.openstory.catalog.storage.DiscoverPersistenceInstrumentedTest,app.openstory.catalog.storage.CatalogIdentityIntegrityInstrumentedTest \
  --no-daemon
./gradlew verifyArchitecture detekt --no-daemon
```

The focused connected Room command is accepted as user-reported PASS on one available Android
target. The first broad command verified every architecture check, then Detekt failed on four
Task 2 findings: two generic catch boundaries, a three-throw mapping helper, and the intentionally
deferred retention parameter. The source preserves the same failure/cancellation semantics
through value-based failure mapping, removes both generic catches, and narrowly documents the
Task 4-owned unused parameter. The user reran `./gradlew verifyArchitecture detekt --no-daemon` on
the remediated tree and reported `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`; Task 2 is accepted. Task 13 later repeats Room
behavior on API 26 and 37.

## Task 2 Self-Review

- The hot-path observer is one state-left-join-card SQL shape; summary/detail changes cannot
  invalidate it, an inner join cannot collapse an empty publication, and no broad JSON/blob or
  per-card read contract exists.
- Publication validation occurs before the transaction and is repeated from an immutable card
  snapshot at the store boundary; all DB mutation then commits or rolls back as one Room
  transaction. Typed validation/identity failures remain specific, while unrelated framework
  failures map to the matching storage operation and caller cancellation is rethrown.
- Identity has both exact source-key and derived Story-ID uniqueness. A mismatched persisted
  triple fails as `IdentityCollision` without suffix, random, or insertion-order repair.
- Primary/index order covers the bounded current-generation query and both duplicate membership
  invariants. Section/card cap rejection is enforced through the only product write boundary,
  not an invented DAO bypass or unsupported Room check annotation.
- The exported schema starts at version 1 and contains no V1 migration history, detail children,
  retention table, startup initializer, service, provider, network dependency, or app-owned DB
  access. Factory construction performs no Room work; opening is explicit and final close is
  idempotent.
- An independent review dispatch was attempted under the review skill but the child runtime had
  no active provider credentials. The root therefore completed the required changed-cone review
  directly; no unresolved in-scope source defect was found before the open device/broad gates.

## Task 3 Delta

- Added the keyed Story Detail Room schema: `story_detail` plus position-keyed `story_author`,
  `story_artist`, and `story_genre` tables. Detail source version/acquisition time remains separate
  from the mutable Discover summary, and ordered child values are reconstructed by persisted
  position.
- Added a `StorySourceRef`-keyed transactional observer. Room's generated implementation performs
  one joined identity/summary/detail query plus exactly one bounded relation query for each child
  table, for four SQL statements per coherent snapshot independent of unrelated Catalog rows.
- Added one atomic `publishStoryDetail` transaction that snapshots mutable lists, repeats complete
  validation at the storage boundary, verifies exact persisted identity, upserts summary/detail,
  replaces all bounded children, preserves monotonic access time, and maps unrelated rollback
  failures to `Storage(PUBLISH_STORY)` without changing materialized Discover cards.
- Added explicit access-touch storage behavior with no observation-driven writes. Touch and later
  detail publication advance an existing orphan candidate's aging timestamp monotonically so
  retention order cannot become stale.
- Added the storage-internal `story_orphan_retention` DAO/index and atomic release cleanup. It uses
  only keyed current-Discover reachability/detail checks plus `LIMIT 65`/`LIMIT 1` indexed orphan
  queries, retains at most 64 candidates after commit, excludes active protected IDs from eviction,
  and deletes unreachable no-detail or evicted Story rows through identity-owned cascades.
- Added instrumentation contracts for summary-before-detail, full detail/child round-trip,
  four-query shape with 250 unrelated rows, atomic rollback, provenance independence, Discover
  isolation, storage-boundary revalidation, explicit access writes, aged 500-row retention query
  shape, the 64-row cap, release cleanup, current reachability, and child-position uniqueness.

## Task 3 Agent-Owned Evidence

- TDD RED: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` failed on the
  missing Task 3 Story Detail/retention schema and store APIs before production implementation, as
  expected, 2026-09-09.
- Focused GREEN compile: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` -
  PASS (exit 0), 2026-09-09.
- Focused final gate: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:assembleDebug
  :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 24s`,
  36 actionable tasks (2 executed, 34 up-to-date), 2026-09-09.
- User-run RED evidence: the selected connected suite ran 14 tests and failed only
  `oneStorySnapshotUsesFourQueriesRegardlessOfUnrelatedRows`, with `expected:<4> but was:<5>`.
  Generated Room 2.8.4 code confirmed the `@Relation` adapter stepped the parent SELECT once to
  collect relation keys, reset it, and stepped it again to materialize the row before executing
  the three child SELECTs.
- Remediation replaces the generated relation adapter with an invalidation-tracked observer whose
  snapshot read is one explicit Room transaction: one keyed parent DAO query plus one ordered
  authors, artists, and genres query. The same instrumentation assertion remains the RED/GREEN
  behavioral contract.
- The same user-run broad gate passed the architecture checks but Detekt failed on the Task 3
  `evictOneOverflow` helper's three returns. The helper now selects a nullable eviction and has one
  final return without changing the bounded overflow behavior.
- Post-remediation focused gate: `./gradlew :catalog:storage:assembleDebug
  :catalog:storage:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin --no-daemon` - PASS (exit 0), 2026-09-09.
- Generated schema review confirms the five Task 3 tables, detail route uniqueness, child primary
  keys/foreign keys, and `(last_accessed_epoch_ms, story_id)` retention index.
- Post-remediation generated DAO review confirms each of the four Story SELECT methods executes its
  statement once; the storage observer composes them inside one transaction. No production
  retention query contains global `COUNT(*)` or history-wide `ORDER BY story_detail`.

## Task 3 Required User-Owned Gate

Status: **PASS / ACCEPTED**

```bash
./gradlew :catalog:storage:connectedDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=app.openstory.catalog.storage.StoryDetailPersistenceInstrumentedTest,app.openstory.catalog.storage.StoryRetentionInstrumentedTest \
  --no-daemon
./gradlew verifyArchitecture detekt --no-daemon
```

The first returned results exposed and drove the two remediations recorded above. The user rerun
on the remediated tree reports `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` for both required commands, 2026-09-09. Task 3 is
accepted. Task 13 later repeats Room behavior on API 26 and API 37.

## Task 3 Self-Review

- Story reads are keyed by the full validated route identity and observe only the selected summary,
  optional detail, and its three bounded child tables. The generated query set is fixed at four;
  unrelated row count cannot amplify SQL statement count or result cardinality.
- Complete detail state publishes inside one Room transaction. A forced child insert failure rolls
  back description, authors, artists, genres, provenance, and summary together; detail enrichment
  never writes `discover_card`.
- Detail provenance is owned by `story_detail` and survives later Discover summary/source-version
  publication. Summary-only projections remain valid before enrichment.
- Retention work is driven only by the released Story plus a maximum 65-row indexed candidate read
  and one indexed unprotected eviction lookup. No production global Story/detail enumeration,
  count, or history sort was introduced.
- Observation performs no access write. Explicit touch/detail refresh keeps both detail and an
  existing orphan marker monotonic, avoiding reactive write loops and stale eviction order.
- DAO-shaped retention methods and Room entities remain module-internal. No runtime/app/network,
  startup, V1 quarantine, or new dependency edge was introduced.
- Independent review dispatch was attempted under the review skill but the child runtime returned
  `404 No active credentials for provider: openai`. The root completed the required changed-cone
  review directly; the final connected behavior and broad architecture/Detekt reruns are accepted.

## Later Task Status

Tasks 0-3: **COMPLETED/ACCEPTED**. Task 4: **READY TO START**.
Tasks 5 through 16: **NOT RUN**.

## Risks / Open Checks

- API 26/API 37 repetition, later device/UI, performance, profile, and plugin-integration gates
  remain owned by later tasks and are `NOT RUN`.

## Exact Resume Boundary

Task 3 is completed/accepted. Resume Step 2 at plan Task 4, Step 1. Re-read Task 4's contract and
only its direct storage/runtime dependency cone before writing RED publication/identity tests. Do
not execute Task 4 in the Task 3 closure turn.
